Smart Plant Pot

So far I have used the "Blynk" app for communication between Flaura, servers and smartphones. This makes it possible to send data from the smart plant pot to the Blynk server and later display it on the smartphone. At the same time, it is possible to use it to control the plant pot with the smartphone.

Unfortunately, Blynk's pricing policy has changed significantly in the meantime. Now there is no longer any practical way for DIY enthusiasts, makers or developers to use the app for free. For almost all the important functions a monthly paid subscription is needed now. At the same time, users of the old Blynk version, who in some cases have already paid a lot of money for the activation of individual features, are left in the lurch and a refund of the money is refused. This upset not only me, but also many other people, which you can see from the Blynk rating in the Play Store of just 1.1 out of 5 stars.

In my opinion, Blynk is no longer the right software solution for Flaura under the new circumstances, which is why I decided to look for an alternative way of transferring data between Flaura, servers and smartphones.

I have now uploaded the previous Arduino program code for the ESP32 microcontroller of Flaura to GitHub. It is an unfinished version that was designed for use with Blynk. But it might still be useful for some of you if you want to experiment a bit until I find a new software solution for data transfer.
